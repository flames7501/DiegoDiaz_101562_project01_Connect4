# Project #1
Hello! And welcome to my first project of this trimester, a game of Connect Four! The players must click on one of the seven columns to drop a disc (alternating between yellow and red, yellow going first). Once four (or more) of the discs of the same color are next to one another in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal form, the player of that color wins!
